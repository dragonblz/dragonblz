## 🧠 About Me

I’ve been learning and building with code since I was **11 years old**.  
What started as curiosity turned into years of disciplined problem-solving, debugging, and system thinking.

I care about **strong fundamentals**, **clean logic**, and **writing code that holds up under responsibility** — not just code that “works once”.

I’m aiming for **serious technical roles**, long-term projects, and teams that value ownership, reliability, and growth.
